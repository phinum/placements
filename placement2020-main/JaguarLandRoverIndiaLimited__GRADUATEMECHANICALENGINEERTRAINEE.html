In the world of automotive design and manufacturing, a Graduate Mechanical Engineer Trainee (GMET) plays a key role.                 <br/>                 Our mechanical engineering graduate program has been designed to be just as inspiring as the cars you’ll help produce. The program is an accelerated program for engineers to develop a broad exposure as well as depth in mechanical engineering through innovative projects, intense technical &amp; leadership training and mentorships to build world class engineers. You will experience different disciplines such as Body Engineering, Chassis Engineering, Powertrain and Vehicle Engineering and be involved in Virtual and Physical engineering using tools including 3D CAD, 1D and 3D Simulation.                 <br/>                 The core role of the engineer is to create, integrate and release systems, components and vehicles - and so the GMET position demands a dynamic individual who can adapt to a constantly changing environment, executing and successfully delivering time-constrained automotive mechanical intensive programs of work. You will be an integral part of contributing to JLR’s next generation vehicle programs and innovative mechatronic solutions working in cross-functional engineering development teams. Join us in this pioneering area and it will be your ideas and expertise that forms part of our product range that sets the benchmark for automotive innovation across the globe. Upon successful completion of the graduate program, your final placement will then be based on business requirements, performance and your personal aspirations.                </p>                <p>                 <br/>                 <strong>                  What to expect?                 </strong>                 <br/>                 We want to develop you to become a world class engineer and we believe that the best development will be from working on live programmes so you’ll be able make tangible, strategic contributions to the company’s success right from the start of your career - by being involved in developing and delivering engineering solutions to our vehicles working with mentors at the forefront of their field who will make sure that you get the growth needed. The program will be for 2 years with typical projects being up to 6 months in duration.                 <br/>                 As a GMET graduate you will work in or with different departments within Product Engineering (e.g. Body Engineering, Chassis Engineering, Mechanical &amp; Electric Powertrain and Vehicle Engineering). This may include different domains, tools, skills and experiences within departments as wide and as varied as the car itself such as Bumper Systems, Engine gas management, Doors, Suspension Systems and many more. What we can assure is you will remain intellectually engaged - always!                </p>                <p>                 <strong>                  Who we are looking for:                 </strong>                 <br/>                 Our cars are the embodiment of our approach to life.
